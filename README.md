## **Meta's latest LLM llama3 released and available to users through HuggingFace API**

### **Introduction**
In this project, I used a pre-trained quantized version of llama3-base on Salesforce customer service data set and used PEFT/LoRA to reduce update size and 
help fit model into memory. 

The model is then fine-tuned on Salesforce customer service dataset on a Lightning.ai T4 GPU (24GB) RAM where it trained without any issue.
